				<p>At the age of 16, from 1926 to 1930, Miedinger apprenticed as a type designer with the printer Jacques Bollmann in Zurich.</p>

				<p>He did an apprenticeship as a typesetter at the Bollmann printing house in Zurich from 1926 to 1930, then went to the Zurich School of Arts and Crafts. From 1936 to 1946 he worked as a graphic designer for the Globus department stores' chain. Then he changed to Haas'schen Schriftgiesserei in Münchenstein near Basel, for which he worked as a customer adviser and salesman until 1956.</p>

				<p>After completing his apprenticeship, he worked for various companies from 1930 to 1936, while attending evening classes at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Zurich. From 1936 to 1946 he worked as a typographer in the advertising workshop of the Globus department stores' in Zurich, and from 1947 to 1956 as a customer advisor and font salesman at the Haas foundry in Münchenstein and then in Basel.</p>

				<p>From 1956 he worked as a freelance graphic designer and in the same year he was commissioned by the director of Haas'schen Schriftgiesserei to design a new Grotesk. In 1957, Miedinger delivered the Neue Haas Grotesk in a semi-bold cut, followed by the lean cut in 1958 and the bold cut in 1959. The typeface quickly became successful and was distributed internationally as Helvetica in 1960 and has been copied many times since.</p>
